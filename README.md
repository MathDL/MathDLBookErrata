In this file we will keep errata associated to the book ["Mathematical Foundations of Deep Leanring Models and Algorithms"](https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=GSM/252&_zs=hX3BH1&_zl=C09q7) published by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) in 2025.

1. Page 11: There is an $m$ missing at the formula right after (1.9). That formula should read\
   $`\Lambda(\theta)\overset{\text{def}}{=} \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M \ell_{y_{m}}(\mathfrak{m}(x_{m};\theta)), `$
2. Page 15: The first bullet point after (1.11) should read
   "If the data set is too small and the model $\mathfrak{m}(x;\theta)$ is not trained on sufficient enough data points, then the model will have large variance."
3. Page 219: Around the model, it should be $\mathfrak{m}(\textbf{X};\theta)$ instead of $\mathfrak{m}(\textbf{X},\theta).$
