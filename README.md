In this file we will keep errata associated to the book ["Mathematical Foundations of Deep Leanring Models and Algorithms"](https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=GSM/252&_zs=hX3BH1&_zl=C09q7) published by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) in 2025.

1. Page 11: There is an $m$ missing at the formula right after (1.9). That formula should read
   $$
      \Lambda(\theta)\overset{\text{def}}{=} \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M \ell_y_{m}(\mathfrak{m}(x_{m};\theta)),
   $$
